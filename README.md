# Hackathon Project: OlympiPredict

## Team Members
- **Faiz Mustansar**: Lead
- **Fawaz Rizwan**: Developer
- **Talha Naveed**: Developer

## Project Overview
Our hackathon project aims to predict the medal winners of the 2024 Paris Olympics by analyzing data from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics and other relevant datasets. We will leverage machine learning techniques and data analysis to make informed predictions about the performance of various countries in the upcoming games.

## Project Structure
### 1. Data Collection
- **Datasets**: 
  - Tokyo 2021 Olympics medal tally
  - Athlete statistics (age, gender, previous performances)
  - Coach information
  - Country-specific data (GDP, investment in sports)
  - Historical Olympic performance data
- **Sources**: 
  - [Olympic Official Website](https://olympics.com/)
  - [Sports Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/2021/)
  - [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/)

### 2. Data Preparation
- **Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inaccuracies.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features such as medal weight, total athletes, and investment per athlete.

### 3. Data Analysis and Visualization
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **EDA**: Explore data distributions, correlations, and key trends.

### 4. Model Training
- **Models**: Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks
- **Training**: Split data into training and testing sets, train models, and validate performance.

### 5. Prediction and Evaluation
- **Metrics**: Mean Squared Error, RÂ² Score
- **Visualization**: Predicted medal counts vs. actual counts, feature importance plots
